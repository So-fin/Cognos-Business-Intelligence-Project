Tell a story

Task Details
This is probably the most important skill for a Data Scientist - the ability to communicate the story. You have worked hard over the last two tasks for understand the data and discover patterns and relationships. It is time to put all that to good use. 

Find one story worth telling based on all your work. Create a notebook that walks the viewer through the entire story, one step at a time. 

A few tips - 
•	Pick an interesting conclusion that you want to arrive at
•	Build a logical progression from loading and pre-processing data to showing minor observations along the way and eventually building up to the grand finale
•	Substantiate your argument with data along the way (you are a data scientist not just a story teller :))
•	Every good story has some key elements - characters, setting, plot, complication and solution, try to build as many of them as you can.
•	Deliver for the aha moment! Give the user an insight that can potentially impact the business. If the viewer doesn't get that then they won't appreciate your effort.
